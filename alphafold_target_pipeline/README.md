# 🧬 AlphaFold Target Pipeline — DHFR Structure Prediction & Analysis

This folder contains the full workflow for predicting and analyzing the **human Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR)** structure using **AlphaFold (via ColabFold)**, followed by structural visualization in Python using **py3Dmol**.

DHFR is an essential enzyme involved in **DNA synthesis**, and it is a key drug target for many anticancer and antimicrobial therapies. The following images illustrate various aspects of the predicted protein structure.

## 📁 **Files Included**
- **PDB output files** (`DHFR_rank1.pdb` … `DHFR_rank5.pdb`) — AlphaFold model predictions  
- **PNG images** — Generated from structural analysis  
- **Notebooks** used for prediction and visualization

All structural outputs and images are stored in:
